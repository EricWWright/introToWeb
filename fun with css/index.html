            <h2>Commentary</h2>
            <p>On June 1, 1865, Senator Charles Sumner commented on what is now considered the most famous speech by
                President Abraham Lincoln. In his eulogy on the slain president, he called it a "monumental act." He
                said Lincoln was mistaken that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here." Rather,
                the Bostonian remarked, "The world noted at once what he said, and will never cease to remember it. The
                battle itself was less important than the speech."</p>

        <h2>The Gettysburg Address</h2>
        <h3>November 19, 1863</h3>
        <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in
            Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
        <img src="bee.jpg" id="bee" class="rounded-corners shadow">
        <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
            dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a
            portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
            live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>

        <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The
            brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
            detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they
            did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
            here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
            before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
            last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain --
            that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the
            people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
