        <h3>" Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. <br> Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which
            is living with the results of other people's thinking. " <br> ~ <strong><em>Steve Jobs</em></strong></h3>
        <p>When I graduate I would hope that I get a job at a well paying company that values their associates. <br> I
            would also love to go on a nice two week long vacation to celebrate my success on getting my degree.</p>
        <p>Some more things I would like to do when I graduate is to spend more time making playing and making music.
            <br>If I end up going web in collage, then I would like to make my own websites to manage, opperate, and
            design.</p>
