        <p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is <em>Eric Wright</em> and I'm currently 19 years of age.<br>I was born and
            mostly raised in Tooele, Utah.<br>I am a musician who plays cello and five string bass.</p>
        <p>My interest in computer science started when I was seven years old when my dad introduced me to his personal
            computer. <br>He decided to leave it in my room and allowed me to play some games on it like Monopoly.</p>
