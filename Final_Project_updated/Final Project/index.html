    <img id="slideshow" src="slideshow/professor.jpg"  >
    <p id="index-main"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here at Future Technologies we are striving to not only be the first time travel provider on the market but also the best.
    Through years of dedication and countless hours of work we are proud to introduce the first time machine to be sold on the market.
    We know there has been some controversy around a publicly owned time machine but rest assured with our extinsive testing we guarantee   
    that no tampering with our current time line will occur. Our product allows the user to not interfere with the time line but experience
    it passively so you can truly feel and see history as it actually happens.
    </p>
    <p id="index-main2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Time travel is only the starting point for use. Future Technologies is dedicated to being in the forefront
        of development for all revolutionary tech in the industry. We are looking forward to a bright future and hope to bring the top 
        advancements in the industry to the user at home.
