        <h2>Specifications</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Watch: </b> The watch is going to be used for keeping track of time. It also serves as destination planner for a time period that someone may want to travel to.
         With some watch it can be made to keep a year as well which could function as a timekeeper for the place that you may travel to.
    </p>
    <p>
         <b>Compass: </b> A compass would be used to test the gravity that may be exerted at the time. This would help give some insight of what it may feel outside of the chamber. 
         Since a compass’s function is to point in the direction depending on the gravitational pull of the planet. It serves as warning before stepping out of the chamber to tell whether it is safe to exit.
    </p>
    <p>
         <b>Computer: </b> A computer would allow someone to initialize the startup process so it wouldn’t have to be done manually. It also could be act as a services point giving someone 
         information about the time that they may have traveled to. The computer can also be remotely accessed so it can be sent to another time stream to test if it is safe to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Power Supply: </b> A power supply is used to give power to the computer and watch so it could run without stopping. It would power on some of the cabin area so there wouldn’t be so much strain on the engine.
   </p>
   <p>
        <b>Engine: </b> The engine purpose is to get the systems running and power up so when someone is ready to go it can quick start which can allow faster travel time and return times as well. 
        It can also power the computer and watch in case the power supply would malfunction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Gravity Regulator: </b> A gravity regulator would help maintain the inside cabins gravity to a comfortable measurement. This would help when traveling so no outside force wouldn’t overcome the interior 
        of the cabin. It also would allow someone to comfortably operate the machine without an outside distraction that could cause mishaps.
   </p>
   <p>
        <b>Titanium Material: </b> Titanium would be used for building part of the cabin and supports that can help against gravitational pressure that could happen when traveling in between timelines. 
        Titanium is also easier to work with than tungsten, it is also less dense than steel and tungsten. This makes it a viable option to hold against any weight that the cabin may sub come to.
